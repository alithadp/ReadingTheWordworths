		var notes = "In Dorothy's journal, she and William find rest in nature--like the daffodils that \"rested their heads upon [...] stones as on a pillow for weariness\" (ll. 10-11), she and William \"rested again and again\" (l. 19).  The parallel use of \"rested\" in relation to the daffodils and the \"we\" sets up a relationship between Dorothy and William and the daffodils.  Dorothy separates the daffodils into two categories: those that are \"rest[ing]\" (l. 10) and the \"rest\" (l. 11).  The play on the verb \"rested\" (l. 10) and the noun \"rest\" (l. 11) reinforces the link between resting in nature and then feeling rejuvenated.  Because Dorothy and William and the daffodils are linked together through the act of \"rest[ing],\" Dorothy and William become a part of the natural scene.  Thus, the rejuvenation that nature provides for the daffodils is also available to Dorothy and William.</p><p>In \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,\" though, William does not recognize the \"wealth the show to him had brough\" (l. 18) until he has left nature, and is \"on [his] couch\" (l. 19), presumably trying to rest.  Therefore, unlike Dorothy, who sees an inclusive nature, William sees man and nature as separate entities: even when man is <i>in</i> nature, he is apart from it, failing to realize the \"wealth\" that nature offers.  This separation that William enforces can perhaps be explained in terms of William's vision for his poetry.  In the Preface, he writes that \"to endeavor to produce or enlarge this capability [of being find intellectual pleasure with finer, subtler stimuli] is one of the best services in which, at any period, a writer can be engaged,\" one that he himself has taken up.<sup class=\"7\">7</sup> Telling his readers that they can find pleasure by \"rest[ing]\" in nature as Dorothy suggests, then, would actually undermine William's argument in the Preface and make what William offers with his poetry--a way to \"enlarge\"<sup class=\"7\">7</sup> the mind's ability to find pleasure--available without his poetry's mediation.</p>";

William, on the other hand, uses a variation of the verb \"floated\" in an entirely different context.  His verb, \"floats\" (l. 2) is linked to the poem's \"I,\" an entity that clearly is an image of \"self\" that Fay mentions.  The speaker in \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" borrows Dorothy's language, but uses it to separate himself from that language.

While the words \"sprightly\" and \"sprung\" are not necessarily related, the connection between them is largely connotative--we generally think that sprightly things spring about.  In the context of the poem, however, William uses meter to his advantage, further linking the two words.  The iambic tetrameter of the line makes the phrase \"in sprightly\" spring aurally: the unstressed \"in\" is like the compression of a spring, the stressed \"spright-\" is the release, and the unstressed \"-ly\" does the work of gravity, bringing the stressed syllable back down.  By relying on connotation and the poetry's metric form, William emphasizes the daffodils' vivacity that Dorothy evokes in a way that helps establish him as \"the working, romantic poet\" that Levin says he wants to be.<sup class=\"6\">6</sup>");
		mouseHilite(["glancing", "sparkle"],["#F1E3FF", "#F1E3FF"], "Dorothy's single use of \"glancing\" becomes four different words in William's poem.  As a part of a visual description, \"glancing\" describes the effect of light on the daffodils, but as a gerund that comes after Dorothy personifies daffodils--these daffodils are \"danc[ing]\" (l. 12) and \"laugh[ing]\" (l. 13) very much like people would--\"glancing\" also takes on the meaning of \"looking.\"  Therefore, rather than merely reflecting the sunlight, the daffodils are also \"glancing\" or looking at Dorothy and William while Dorothy and William look at the daffodils.  This reciprocal looking, however, is not in \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.\"  Though \"shine\" (l. 7), \"twinkle\" (l. 8), \"sparkling\" (l. 14), and \"flash\" (l. 21) all embody the play of light on objects like \"glancing\" does, none of them involve the natural scene looking back at William.  When William does use words related to looking (\"glance\" and \"gazed\"), he is careful to attribute that act of looking to the \"I\": in line 11, the \"I\" sees the daffodils \"at a glance,\" and in line 17, the \"I\" is the one that \"gazes.\"</p><p>William's choice of \"flash\" also operates to differentiate his idea of nature from Dorothy's: William sees a static nature, while Dorothy sees a \"changing\" one (l. 14).  \"Flash\" brings to mind photography, which freezes and preserves a scene as it is, and also suggests a singular scene that appears in his mind's eye.  In Dorothy's description, however, the light \"glanc[es]\" off the daffodils, which are also moving in the wind.  Because the daffodils move as light hits them, the \"glancing\" becomes a function of time, and causes the scene to change.  In this way, Dorothy's \"glancing\" allows the scene to change in ways that William's \"flash\" does not.</p>");
		mouseHilite(["tossed", "tossing"],["#F1E3FF", "#F1E3FF"], "In his choice of \"tossing\" (l. 12), we see William again borrowing Dorothy's words.  However, William does not incorporate the verb \"reeled\" (DW l. 12) anywhere in his poem, despite its similarities to \"toss\"--both describe a free sort of movement that happens in the air.  One potential reason for this is related to the ideas discussed in the notes triggered by \"under\" (DW l. 6) and by \"stragglers\" (DW l. 16).  William tends to simplify the scene before him so that it coheres in a more purposeful way.  That impulse operates here in his choice of \"tossed\" over \"reeled\" because \"toss\" connotes a sense of control that \"reel\" does not.  Though William uses \"fluttering\" (l. 6), a verb that connotes similar types of movements \"reeling\" would, it does not have the almost erratic force that \"reeling\" does.  Thus, when William writes that the daffodils are \"fluttering\" (l. 6) or \"tossing\" (l. 12) rather than \"reeling,\" he maintains an amount of control over the scene he describes--one that is necessary if he is to recollect a scene that generates \"powerful feelings\" in \"tranquility.\"<sup class=\"7\">7</sup>  As Homans says, \"William looks at nature for the sake of the mind, whereas Dorothy, unwilling even to call it a vision, looks at nature for its own sake.\"<sup class=\"5\">5</sup>");

The change from noun to present tense works much like Dorothy's repetition of \"rest\" and its variations (l. 10, 11, 19).

Her uses of \"along\" take advantage of the parts-of-speech double dipping that \"along\" engages in: the first \"along\" acts as an adverb, and the second \"along\" acts as the preposition.  Because the two are used in close proximity, the second use of \"along\" as the preposition brings with it the previous use of \"along\" as adverb.  Thus, her descriptions connote a sort of movement and continuity, which then works to reinforce her belief that nature is \"ever changing\" (l. 14).</p><p>While Dorothy uses the \"along\" exclusively, William uses a mix of \"beside\" and \"along.\"  Even though the two words mean almost the same thing, their meanings in the context of these two texts seem to differ.  William's use of \"beside,\" particularly in the first stanza (l. 5), lacks the dynamic sense that \"along\" conveys, perhaps because we rarely use \"beside\" as an adverb.  In the third stanza, \"beside\" (l. 13) is accompanied with \"danced,\" which, when held against Dorothy's use of \"along,\" does the work that the adverb/preposition \"along\" does in Dorothy's description.  When William does use \"along,\" he uses it in concert with \"the margin of a bay\" (l. 10), which, of course, is the image in \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" that most matches Dorothy's description of the daffodils she sees.

But if we look more closely at what Dorothy's preposition modifies, we see that the daffodils are actually \"under the <i>boughs</i> of the trees\" (l. 6, emphasis added).  William's description cuts out Dorothy's first prepositional phrase to say, perhaps more concisely, where the daffodils are.  When compared with Dorothy's description, which allows the parts to exist with the whole, William's description then seems to subordinate the parts (the \"boughs\") to the whole (the \"trees\").  This idea of \"whole\" taking the place of \"parts\" is closely related to the idea of William's reworking of the natural scene to present a more unified picture.  By cutting out the \"boughs,\" William, in a figurative sense, cleans up the picture his visual imagery evokes.

In the phrase \"looked so gay\" (l. 13) a similar degree of uncertainty is present--the daffodils are not necessarily \"gay,\" but they do \"look\" as though they are.  In \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,\" William's speaker does away with the uncertainty implicit in Dorothy's description.  He says that the poet \"[c]ould not be but gay\" (l. 15), removing the possibility of unhappiness for his poet that Dorothy leaves for her daffodils.  Though Dorothy's \"soft\" descriptions leave room for William's speaker to assert himself, they also work to account for Dorothy's belief that the natural scene is \"ever changing\" (l. 14).
